# learn-clojure
A breadcrumb trail of Clojure related learning resources.

## Prerequisite Learning

Every modern system comes with a shell program. The shell is a program which allows the user to initiate, monitor and manage the running of other programs on the system. The system's files and directories can also be managed from the shell.

A big part of programming is making sure the right files, with the right contents are located in the right places within your computer's file-system.

At first, you can get by with learning the bare minimum or even nothing at all about working in the shell and still make progress in your learning path. There's nothing wrong with manipulating files and directories in your system's Graphical User Interface (GUI), especially if that's what you already know. However, a lot of documentation on the web will assume you know how to operate a shell. The earliest versions of this documentation assume this too. In time we will create a path for non-shell users.

If you've never used the shell, please first go through the [Intro to Command Line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) tutorial at the Django Girls site. This tutorial was chosen because it covers just enough material to get you started without distracting you with excessive detail. It also provides separate instructions for Linux, OS X, and Windows systems. If you are a Windows user, please go through the tutorial once and learn the built-in Windows commands and then repeat the tutorial after reading the note below to Windows users and installing Babun. On your second time through, follow the instructions for Linux shell commands. Many web docs ignore Windows users. Achieving this small goal will pay off big for you over time by being able to follow many online docs written for Linux users.

Now you're ready to start learning some Clojure, but if you curious to learn more about working from the command line, a.k.a. the shell, you might enjoy the [Linux Command](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0050.php) site.

Proceed to the section below [Learning Paths](#learning-paths).


## A note to Windows users
In order to simplify this training material for both writers and readers, we assume that you are using bash or zsh with standard tools such as git, grep, wget, curl, etc. The best way to achieve this on a Windows machine is to install and use [Babun](http://babun.github.io/). For more details on installing Babun, please see the freely available video series *[Command Line Power User](https://youtu.be/rl7PzPAZDyY)* by Wes Bos. 


## Learning Paths

No two learners are exactly alike. Nonetheless we will strive to categorize learners in a general way to help you pick the path forward that best matches your present circumstance.
